1. In your reddit_relative.py, what intermediate results did you .cache()? 
Briefly describe what would have happened if you hadn't used .cache() anywhere.
(No need to time it, unless you really want to.)

> I cached the averages and max_relative_score dataframes.
> I chose these because they were intermediate dataframes that were used only to compute results then join back to the larger "comments" dataframe.
> If I hadn't used cache, the dataframes would have been computed to calculate the intermediate df, the results would be thrown away, and then recalculated when I want to use them again.
> As a result, I would be performing the calculations numerous times, and because this is a costly task it would have resulted in a longer runtime.

2. How did marking DataFrames for broadcast affect the running time of the “best author” program above?

> Without Broadcast (vanilla run): http://master.sfucloud.ca:8088/cluster/app/application_1506888802885_17726
> Time (via the CLI time command):
> real    0m52.124s
> user    0m39.028s
> sys     0m1.680s
> Elapsed Time (via the front-end): 44 seconds

> With Broadcast: http://master.sfucloud.ca:8088/cluster/app/application_1506888802885_17727
> Time (via the CLI time command): 
> real    0m47.550s
> user    0m34.036s
> sys     0m1.416s
> Elapsed Time (via the front-end): 38 seconds

> As expected, the use of broadcast resulted in a faster runtime for the programs execution
> The results as seen on the front-end showed a 6 second decrease in runtime (13.6% speed increase)
> The results as seen from the time command showed a 4.575 second decrease in runtime (8.8% speed increase)
