1. In the hint above, describe the values that are the result of data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept? 
How is this calculated?

> The result is a linear regression line, with the form of y = mx + b where
> m is the slope (fit.slope)
> b is the intercept (fit.intercept)
> and x is our independant variable (timestamp in this case)
> This creates a line of a predicted value for y (rating), based on each value of x (timestamp)


2. In the same hint, why does this produce a fit line on the graph? 
Why are the created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly to make points on the plot?

> This creates a fit line because it follows the y=mx+b equation for a straight line graph (as mentioned in #1)
> It uses the timestamp values as a dependent variable to approximate the rating for any given timestamp
> The created_at values were in datetime format, which is great for human readability
> > However, datetime isn't convenient for data transformation, because there are too many states the date could be in (month/day/year/etc.)
> > To simplify this, convert the date to a timestamp, s.t. all dates can be the same format; a number
> > > And these numbers increase in value as time progresses, so it's easy to compare the date amongst the timestamp data
