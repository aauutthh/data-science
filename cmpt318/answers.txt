1. In the hint above, describe the values that are the result of data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept? 
How is this calculated?

2. In the same hint, why does this produce a fit line on the graph? 
Why are the created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly to make points on the plot?
