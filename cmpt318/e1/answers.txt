1. Where you did the same calculations with NumPy and Pandas, 
which did you find easier to work with? 
Which code do you think is easier to read?

I personally found NumPy to be a bit easier to work with, mainly because of the better documentation.
Pandas has okay documentation, but NumPy provides examples and a more detailed set of arguments/constraints.
Overall, I liked how the functions were basically the same between them, and going from NumPy -> Pandas was seamless.
In terms of readability, Pandas is better because of the way it can take in document headers to deliver more human readible output.

2. What were the running times of the two pivot_months_* functions? 
How can you explain the difference?

The Pandas method resulted in:
10 loops, best of 3: 18.6 ms per loop

The loop method resulted in:
1 loop, best of 3: 536 ms per loop

The pandas method executed ~29% times faster than the loops method.
This is likely due to not having to iterate over all rows/columns of the information, also Pandas has better array management (C-style) 
instead of the Python pointer-based arrays. This allows manipulation of the arrays in Pandas to be more efficient and specialized, and
frankly it's a tool designed for data manipulation, so it would be sad if brute forcing data was comparable in terms of speed.
